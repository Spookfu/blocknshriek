# Block and Shriek
_A Minecraft minigame centered around one goal, scaring your friends. Strategize and fight for 10 Minutes in three unique maps, utilizing spells, map quirks and events, trinkets, and much more!_

## Preface
This is a recreation of the game **[Hide and Shriek](https://store.steampowered.com/app/480430/Hide_and_Shriek/)** in Minecraft with the usage of a Datapack and Resource Pack. _I work on this in my free time, so please be patient! **This may not be finished for a while!**_ 

If you have issues, bug reports, suggestions, or something along those lines, report on the GitHub or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/77jXr2gQ4t).

## Current Progress
The list below shows a simplified version of the roadmap for this project. I'll update this occasionally and add some screenshots to the gallery section whenever possible. Here's some expectations:
1. A semi-stable release of the Map will always be available. This will most likely not include any of the recent things I've added.
2. The Resource pack and its textures will not be final UNTIL the Official Release. If you would like to help with the custom textures, please contact me on Discord.
3. Names of Maps, Runes, Spells, Descriptions, etc. are not Final.
